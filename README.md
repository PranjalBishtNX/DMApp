# DM App

A website to play DM online in the browser.
Similar to TCO, but focused exclusively on DM so the quality and user experience will be much better.

It uses HTML5/JS, the back end is NodeJS with Express.
We're planning to use MongoDB as our go-to database.

The site is deployed here for testing during development:
