# DM App

A website to play DM online in the browser.
Similar to TCO, but focused exclusively on DM so the quality and user experience will be much better and things like turn order and card effects can be implemented.

It uses HTML5/JS, the back end is NodeJS with Express.
We're planning to use MongoDB as our database.

The site is deployed here for testing during development:
